# EBIRD-AB-TEST
Introduction:
Between 1911 and 1986, canaries were an essential part of the coal mining operation. The bird's role was to detect carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases that could endanger the miners' safety. In 1962, Rachel Carson published a book called "Silent Spring." In the book, Ms. Carlson brought awareness about the indiscriminate use of pesticides. She described the adverse effect over the biological system, more explicitly the changing reproduction cycles of birds like the Bald Eagle and the Brown Pelican. 


These are examples of how, in the past, we have used birds as Environmental Indicators. 
In the same line, in this project, we intend to explore the relationship between bird distributions across the continental United States of America with economic and demographic metrics like GDP and Population Density. By describing the relationship of our economy and our society with our environment, we hope to identify parameters that could be subsequently led to a  model that could aid with automated identification and forecast of a probable hazardous environmental scenario.

To achieve our goal, we will arrange our data for the subdivision of interest in this study, the USA. After accessing our samples' normality, we will perform the appropriate parametric or nonparametric test for different scenarios. We will test for relationships between each species observed in the county and the total amount of different species found in the county, and we would also check for the whole amount of individuals watched overtime recorded.

Hypothesis:
Ho: There is no relationship between the average bird distribution in the U.S. the  GDP and the population density.
HA: There are significant relationships between bird distribution in the U.S.

Data:
Bird observations from eBird. A collective enterprise that takes a novel approach to citizen science by developing cooperative partnerships among experts in a wide range of fields: population ecologists, conservation biologists, quantitative ecologists, statisticians, computer scientists, GIS and informatics specialists, application developers, and data administrators. Managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology eBird's goal is to increase data quantity through participant recruitment and engagement globally and to quantify and control data quality issues such as observer variability, imperfect detection of species, and both spatial and temporal bias in data collection.
